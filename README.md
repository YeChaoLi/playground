# about this repo
Sometime I may get lose in trying out some new demos, so I build this playground to collect most of my clumsy code examples.

# update the repo
Just run Upload.sh to push it to remote. 
Note: It will DELETE all the .git and .gitmodule folder to make sure they not became the sub-module to the top.
